Description: Consider a linear predictive regression setting with a potentially large set of candidate predictors. This work is concerned with detecting the presence of out of sample predictability based on out of sample mean squared error comparisons given in Gonzalo and Pitarakis (2023) <doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2023.10.005>.
